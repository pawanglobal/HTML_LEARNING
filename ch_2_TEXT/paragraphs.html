<!--By default, a browser will show 
each paragraph on a new line 
with some space between it and 
any subsequent paragraphs.-->
<p>Paragraph consists of one or more sentences 
 that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The 
 start of a paragraph is indicated by a new 
 line.</p>
<p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up 
 into units of text. For example, a book may have 
 chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under 
 each heading there will be one or more 
 paragraphs.</p>
